# Contributing

Pull requests are more than welcome from everyone and for everything: improvements, bug fixes, documentation, tests, etc.  

## Contributing is easy:

* You can report bugs and request features using the [issues page][issues].



* You can easily work on the code:
  1. Fork the project, then clone the repo
  1. Make your change(s)
  1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Make sure to:
1. Write tests / fix tests relevant to your changes
1. Ensure the build passes: `mvn clean install`
1. Write a [good commit message][git-commit]
1. Describe your pull request - what, why, how, ...
1. Link the pull request to the relevant issue(s) by mentioning them (`#<issue-number>`)
1. Assign relevant labels
1. Be open minded and open for discussion
